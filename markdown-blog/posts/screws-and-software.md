# What can metal screws teach us about coding?

<byline />

When screws<sup>1</sup> are being made, they undergo rigorous bending and rolling. This is often known as working the metal. Once fully wrought, these metal pellets are fired in an oven, which might seem strange at first. After all, why take something after it’s been shaped and soften it up by heating?

Well, the process of forming the screws, while necessary, introduces microscopic regions of high torque, high compression, and high rarefaction. These stresses and imperfections make the screws problematic to work with, since it can cause them to break prematurely, leading to issues or even injury. You wouldn’t want to build a building with these overworked screws.

Luckily, there is a solution: heat is added. Since metal is in many ways a kind of crystal, the increased motion of the atoms with heat allows the metal to recrystallize. Regions of high stress and high internal torque are allowed to reduce and even disappear. This is one of the rare cases in life where two wrongs can make a right. Once the screws have been heated, they are returned to normal temperature and can then be used in projects.

This is not so different from what happens to software as we work on it. Exerting our will onto the code, while of utmost necessity, gradually makes the code harder to work with. Sticking points are introduced, decreasing velocity.

If we can add even a low-effort refactor phase in our development cycle, we can consistently cause these sticking points to be relaxed, making our next iteration faster and more effective.
